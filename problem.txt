Data Project, GORM version

NOTE: the database for this project should be PostgreSQL.


Part 1. SQL scripts to create, drop database

      Create "helper" SQL scripts that make it easy  to run your code.

    - Script 1, "create script" - should create a new database on which the GORM code will run.
    - Script 2, "delete script" - should drop the database of this project. It should also clean   	     up any other resources like users, your "create script" creates.

Part 2. GORM loader script

    - This script should load the entire CSV data into the database.

TASKS

    - Design table schema, based on your CSV.
    - Note that you might have multiple tables. Either for multiple CSV or supporting data like  	   country lists/state lists etc. You must design Primary Key - Foreign Key relations for those.
    *Write GORM code for ...
        - mapping declarations
        - creating schema
        - generating JSON files similar JS data project but this uses your database instead of CSV 		  file.

Part 3: JSON generation [GOLANG]

   - Write a go program that fetches data from  database, and produces 4 JSON files as output.
   - Each JSON file contains the aggregated data for each plot of your data assignment.
   - IMPORTANT the JSON files should NOT have all the data from the tables . Instead, it should    	    contain result of the aggregations that your program does.
   - The structure of JSON should be based on data needed for the HighCharts plot.



Part 4

   - write  HTML / js code  and test against the JSON generated 
   
Part 5- Hosting

   - Host  on Heroku.
